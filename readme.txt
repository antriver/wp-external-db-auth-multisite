=== Wordpress Multisite External Database Authentication ===

A fork of the "External Database Authentication Reloaded" Wordpress plugin.
Designed for use with Wordpress Multisite Networks. Plugin settings are 
stored once and used for every site in the network.
Improved database connections by using PDO. The PEAR MDB2 package is no longer needed.

To install:

A plugin that allows the use of an external database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MSSQL) for authentication into WordPress. Supports various password hashing methods (include PHPass) and user role checks from the external database.

== Description ==

I was looking for something that would allow users to use <a href="http://projectpress.org/">ProjectPress</a> as their login source for their WordPress site. The External DB Authentication plugin was the answer, but it needed to accomodate PHPass. Therefore, new life has been breathed into an old plugin. 
This plugin allows the use of an external MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MSSQL database for authentication into WordPress.  It is required that you know the encryption method for the passwords stored in the external database and allows you to use MD5, SHA1, plaintext, PHPass, or enter the hash/salt method yourself.  It disables password reset/retrieval and account creation within the WordPress system on the user-end, and it doesn't allow updating from the WordPress end back into the external authentication source. 

In addition to authentication the plugin allows you to:
* Choose additional fields, such as first name/last name and website, to be imported into WordPress.
* Enter a custom message for users concerning logins. 
* Do user role checks from the external database: you can set the plugin to check from a specific role field and compare to a value to allow login to WordPress.  

PostgreSQL or MSSQL database authentication requires MDB2 PEAR database abstraction package and relevant database drivers. MySQL continues to use the built-in PHP functions.

== Installation ==

* Prepare your WP admin account on your external database: create an admin account in your external system.
* If using PostgreSQL or MSSQL, install the MDB2 PEAR database abstraction package and relevant database drivers and confirm its include path.
* Change "New User Default Role" in Settings->General, if desired, to whatever level of control you wish externally authenticated users to have.
* Upload `pp_db_auth.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
* Enter your external database settings in Settings->External DB settings

In order to use ProjectPress as an external source to handle WordPress login's, please choose HASH as the 
encryption type.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My admin account for WP doesn't work anymore! =

We're authenticating externally, right?  Make sure the admin account username in the external source, matches the admin username in WordPress. Once it's in there you'll be able to log in as admin with no problems.  If you can't do this, delete the plugin and it'll restore access using your WP admin account.

= Can I still create accounts within WordPress? =

You could, but they don't work properly as it's only checking the external database for login accounts.

= Can I update user information within WordPress? =

No.

= My external database's passwords are hashed with a salt/datestamp/phases of the moon/etc =

Choose "Other" as your encoding method, then enter the method you use in the "Other" textbox as PHP code. If it involves more than the username and password, though, you may need to modify the plugin source code.

= I'm locked out! =

Delete or rename the plugin; if it's a DB connection-related error most likely you have the wrong connection, etc. information for the external database.
